Contributor notes

Their obfuscation process inlined some functions, we can identify and restore them carefully but keep in mind if the deob process is re-ran, it won't capture that work.
My deobfuscator currently doesn't rename method args or local variables, so the deob map only records classes, methods, and fields. Same applies as above. I don't plan on re-running it any time soon so I suggest naming variables!
The deobfuscation process may overly split variables so if you see.
int var1 = 0;
int var2 = var1 + 1;
Please simplify to var1 += 1; or var1++;. Keep both lines as separate declarations since there was some intent behind it.

String building is an egregious offender too. Try to make them coherent if you see a mess.
Don't move any fields or methods. Everything is in the correct place.
Exception messages were stripped out (where you see new RuntimeException("")) but we have other references to be able to restore them.
Prefer official naming, but any name is better than none, as long as it's accurate.
Document document document! If you get the urge to make something understandable with comments, go for it. People after us will love to learn about the engine.
